title: Connecticut Literary Anthology 2021
description: >-
  Although I did not contribute any personal work to this incredible anthology,
  I volunteered to help compilate a study guide to go with this edition of the
  Connecticut Literary Anthology. Specifically, I wrote study questions for
  Torockio's "When It's You."
