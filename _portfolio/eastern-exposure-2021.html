title: Eastern Exposure 2021
description: >-
  For this publication of the annual literary journal, I was the editor-in-chief
  and in charge of managing submissions alongside the editorial board,
  proofreading, and creating the layout of the journal. In addition, I have
  three works published in this edition:


  ​


  "Driver's Education: For Impostors," p. 15-16


  This is a poem that encompasses impostor syndrome and the idea of living in
  the past in the form of a "driver's education" manual. 


  ​


  "I Love My Body," p. 30-32


  A poem that is an ode to self love. 


  ​


  "Boys Trip (Abridged)," p. 40-48


  This memoir journeys through the narrator's white-water rafting trip that was
  taken with friends while navigating grief and personal growth.
