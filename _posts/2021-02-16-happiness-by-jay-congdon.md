*"How do you define happiness?"*

In *Happiness By: A Series*, we interview real people about simple subject matter such as happiness, sadness, insecurities, and anxieties, all in the interest of humanizing society and making people feel a little less lonely in what they are going through.

In this episode, we talk to Jay about his schizoaffective disorder, maintaining mental health, destigmatizing mental illness, and being a father.

This is a special episode, although every segment is special, but my brother and I got to sit down and chat about the heavy stuff for a while. Actually, it was he who wanted to shed light on what he is going through, and I was happy to give him a platform to do that. I am so proud of him and proud to support him, and I hope you all enjoy watching this.

TW for general mental illness discussion and brief mention of suicide.
