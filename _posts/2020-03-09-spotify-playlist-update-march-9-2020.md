Long time, no update! As I go on to announce new projects this year, I figured I would update this playlist as a nice ice breaker. So, here's some songs I've been listening to over the past few months that I've really been enjoying. I've been going through a complete mood overhaul, though if you know me, you know the past few weeks have been very difficult. Thankfully, this is the last day of Mercury in retrograde, so we all should be safe for at least a little while. I've included a few of my favorite songs and artists on this playlist, and I hope you find some favorites of your own too.

Before I list my must listen to's for this playlist, I have a **_big_** announcement to make! Starting this year, I am introducing Happiness By: A Series. It will be a YouTube series starring a different interviewee each episode. It will be discussing human emotions such as happiness, sadness, anxiety, and insecurities on both a general level and a personal level. Everyone is different and everyone is going through life, so it's an outlet for people to talk about what they are going through and to make viewers feel a little less alone in what they are going through too. I don't want to give too much away now, as the interviews are more self-explanatory than a description itself, but I wanted to make everyone aware of what's to come and what I've been working on these past few weeks. For updates, follow our [<u>Instagram</u>](https://www.instagram.com/theinbetween_blog/){: target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}! If you are interested in being an interviewee, feel free to contact me about that and we can set something up!

Anyway, without further ado, here are my must listen to's this week:

- **you should be sad** \- halsey

"and i had no warning 'bout who you are / just glad i made it out without breaking down"

after the release of _manic_ in january and having listened to it for a few months now, this is by far my favorite song off the album. halsey's album is much different from her previous two because of how much more personal it is to herself, writing as ashley instead of halsey. instead of hiding behind a persona, this is all about her life and experiences. she bends genre in this country-pop-esque bop, and experiments throughout the rest of the album too. while i recommend listening to the album in its entirety, for now, give this one a listen.

- **creepin'** - hayley williams

"it always starts as something so simple and innocent but / too much of anything, you never know how to quit"

hayley williams of paramore started releasing solo music in january in lieu of her highly anticipated solo project, titled _petals for armor_. soundwise and lyric wise, williams is branching out to tell a story that is long overdue to be told by herself, with help from her band members. while paramore will eventually be back, williams is sharing her own vision with the world this time around. personally, creepin' is a favorite of mine from the five songs she has released so far. the full album is due to release in may 2020.

- **pink light** \- muna

pink light begins with a piano into with those very words spoken before the song starts in full 80s sounding force. as of right now, pink light is the intro song to the episodes of happiness by: a series that have been made so far, because it's one of the songs that inspired me to start this project. i will get more into my inspirations for this project at a later date though. standing alone, this song is an ode to getting better and knowing that one day it will be better, but couldn't it have been different? i think that's a thought process we all go through, so it's very relatable.
