This week, I've filled my playlist with 20 new(ish) songs, and I've kept 10 favorites from last week. However, if you miss last weeks playlist _that_ much, feel free to jump on over to the last update and add those songs to your own library so you can listen to them as much as you want!

Music is so wildly important to me, and what I'm listening to definitely reflects my moods and how I'm feeling. Last week, I was still allowing myself to wallow in sad emotions, but I realized that eventually, I have to pull myself out of that. Something else about music is that you tend to tie down songs to certain people in your life, and when those people leave, you're still stuck with the music, and now you can't listen to some of your favorite songs.

In order to start my journey of feeling okay again, I've decided this week's playlist will be filled with songs about getting over it, feeling bad for their loss instead of mine, and songs I loved in the past that I wanted to enjoy again. Eventually, I will be able to listen to those songs I can't bring myself to listen to yet, but for now, I'm going to enjoy the ones I can listen to instead.

Here are my must-listen-to's this week!

- **never really over** - katy perry

"Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over / And if I think it over, maybe you'll be comin' over again / And I'll have to get over you all over again"

Katy Perry's newest single sings about reminiscing over a done relationship and wanting maybe just a little more time with that person and feeling absolutely crazy over it. What I've come to discover is the healing process from heartbreak is absolutely not linear, and having these feelings are completely okay. What I love about the chorus of Never Really Over is that it sounds so different from how the rest of the song sounds. The bop begins slower as it builds into this upbeat, whirlwind of a chorus, leaving you literally breathless from singing along. I think she does a great job encapsulating such a feeling though, because the bubbling up of these repressed feelings you keep having really does feel like quite a whirlwind of emotion. This is definitely one of the songs on this playlist that have been on repeat recently.

- **alaska** \- maggie rogers

"cut my hair so i could rock back and forth / without thinking of you / learned to talk and say whatever i wanted to / and i walked off you / and i walked off an old me"

Maggie Rogers was discovered in an NYU masterclass by Pharrell Williams after playing this exact song for him. What he loved so much about Alaska is the blend of folk and dance music, which hasn't really been done before. It's such a fresh new concept, providing nature-esque vibes while simultaneously providing underlying, subtle dance beats that catch the listener's attention. What I love about Maggie Rogers' sound is how relaxed I feel listening to her, and yet she keeps me on my toes. It's so different from what I listen to, and I love the variety it provides. Specifically with the verse I chose, I think it's funny how when someone is going through a hardship or spiraling, their first instinct is to cut and/or dye their hair. When you can't control your life, at least you can control your hair. There's so much power in taking back your physical appearance, and it definitely changes your mood, if only for a little bit.

- **sweet nothing** - calvin harris ft. florence welch

"it isn't easy for me to let it go / and i have swallowed every single word / and every whisper, every sigh / eats away at this heart of mine / and there is a hallow in me now"

This choice is an oldie but a goodie. I just heard it while I was out with friends in a restaurant the other day and was instantly reminded about how much I love this song. As much as I love this song, I found the lyrics wildly relatable. When a meaningful relationship ends, you're left constantly remembering all the good times and words spoken between the two of you, and you're left wondering where it all went south. Sometimes, you never really know, and that's what's most haunting about the whole thing. I'm also a sucker for sad lyrics hidden within upbeat music.

- **this is the last time** - the national

"i won't be vacant anymore / i won't be waiting anymore"

This is also an older song in The National's collection, but this song reflects on relationships and just how dangerous and harsh they can be. Not that I necessarily believe love is a lost cause, but if you're not careful, you can definitely find yourself heartbroken more times than not. However, lead singer Matt Berninger chants this in the chorus of the song as he finally is letting go those negative feelings and allowing himself to be in the present again. I really love this because it definitely is telling of the healing process, and my goal in this week's playlist is to find songs to help me crawl out of the heartbreak rabbit hole and help me move on. This is The Last Time is definitely one of those songs.
