Hello! Long time, no post! **I have a few announcements to make, so feel free to read the whole post!**

First and foremost, I just finished up my junior year of college, which is terrifying, but also very exciting! A lot of things have changed in the past two months since I first started this project, which subsequently has delayed my progress on this project. Nonetheless, I hope you all are staying safe and healthy during these weird times, and keeping busy too. Or not, I know how annoying it can be to feel like you need to be productive all the time. Take care of yourself however you need to!

Like most everyone else, my semester was moved online, and I moved out of my dorm room. Because of that, I couldn't use the program I was working with. I finally downloaded it to my laptop though, and I'm so excited to finish up with Maggie's interview! **We had a lot of fun making this first "episode" of *Happiness By: A Series*, and I'm so thankful that Maggie let me pick her brain a little bit. It was an absolute joy navigating this idea with her.**

Coronavirus definitely put a damper on this project; however, **I was lucky to get one more interview in with my good friend Emma Pons.** I'm hoping that when conditions get better out there, I can resume safely interviewing friends, but for now, I'm happy to work on what I can! I'm very excited to share with the world Emma's interview, as we also had so much fun doing it. I'm hoping to get that up soon!

**I have one last request:** as we know by now, *The In-Between* is a blog about the middle. What drives a lot of the content on this blog is what's going on in real time, either in my life or with the rest of the world. The next piece I am interested in running is an editorial piece on how people have been affected by/coping with the world rapidly changing around them. **What am I asking from anyone who is interested in participating is the last "normal" photo you have of yourself, a recent photo from your quarantine experience, and a little blurb about how life has been for you, whether that is what you've been doing with your time, how your life has shifted over the course of these two months - really, anything you want to say.**

Okay, I'm done talking, I promise. For now, I present to you *Happiness By: Maggie Cayangyang (BLOOPERS)*! Please enjoy, I hope this can bring a little light to your day!
