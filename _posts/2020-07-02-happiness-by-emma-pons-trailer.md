Hello! Long time, no blog! My very good friend Emma and I shot and filmed this interview way back in February, long before the world changed and "unprecedented times" was a phrase you never heard. I FINALLY got around to editing this video, and it brought me such an overwhelming sense of comfort and joy to do so. I think everyone could use a little happiness, and this happiness just happens to be by Emma! (You can find her art Insta [<u>here</u>](http://www.instagram.com/erpstudio){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}!)

*Happiness By: Emma Pons* is out on ***Sunday, July 5th***! In our latest episode, we talk and laugh about social anxiety, ceramics and art, Taylor Swift, therapy, and the ups and downs of relationships! For now, you can catch the trailer down below!

I want to extend a huge thank you to Emma for participating in this little experiment - we had *loads* of fun during this interview!!!

Catch the full thing ***July 5, 2020***!!!
